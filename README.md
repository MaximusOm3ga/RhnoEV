# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


This project is made by Saurish Nagrath

There are various unused components that due to a lack of time or functionality could not be implemented
Some resources from the file sent by Teachnook were missing and as such could not be put in 

Despite my best efforts, the project might lack a certain flair due to my priority to my college exams that are at the same time.
I do apologise for this 

Backend has not been put in as of now.

The changing words on the Home page might take a second or two to load.
